                Theoden's speech at Pelennor is obviously one of the best moments of the story. But what does "a sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises!" mean exactly? I'm particularly interested in "ere" - apparently it means "before". I know the charge occured at dawn, but was the sun not up yet? Did they charge before the sun actually rose, with Theoden acknowledging that this massive battle would happen before the sun shows itself?
